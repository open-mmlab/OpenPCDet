# OpenPCDet

`OpenPCDet` is a clear, simple, self-contained open source project for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. 

It is also the official code release of [`[PointRCNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04244), [`[Part-A^2 net]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03670) and [`[PV-RCNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13192).

## Changelog
[2020-11-27] **Bugfixed:** Please re-prepare the validation infos of Waymo dataset (version 1.2) if you would like to 
use our provided Waymo evaluation tool (see [PR](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet/pull/383)). 
Note that you do not need to re-prepare the training data and ground-truth database. 

[2020-11-10] **NEW:** The [Waymo Open Dataset](#waymo-open-dataset-baselines) has been supported with state-of-the-art results. Currently we provide the 
configs and results of `SECOND`, `PartA2` and `PV-RCNN` on the Waymo Open Dataset, and more models could be easily supported by modifying their dataset configs. 

[2020-08-10] Bugfixed: The provided NuScenes models have been updated to fix the loading bugs. Please redownload it if you need to use the pretrained NuScenes models.

[2020-07-30] `OpenPCDet` v0.3.0 is released with the following features:
   * The Point-based and Anchor-Free models ([`PointRCNN`](#KITTI-3D-Object-Detection-Baselines), [`PartA2-Free`](#KITTI-3D-Object-Detection-Baselines)) are supported now.
   * The NuScenes dataset is supported with strong baseline results ([`SECOND-MultiHead (CBGS)`](#NuScenes-3D-Object-Detection-Baselines) and [`PointPillar-MultiHead`](#NuScenes-3D-Object-Detection-Baselines)).
   * High efficiency than last version, support **PyTorch 1.1~1.7** and **spconv 1.0~1.2** simultaneously.
   
[2020-07-17]  Add simple visualization codes and a quick demo to test with custom data. 

[2020-06-24] `OpenPCDet` v0.2.0 is released with pretty new structures to support more models and datasets. 

[2020-03-16] `OpenPCDet` v0.1.0 is released. 


## Introduction


### What does `OpenPCDet` toolbox do?

Note that we have upgrated `PCDet` from `v0.1` to `v0.2` with pretty new structures to support various datasets and models.

`OpenPCDet` is a general PyTorch-based codebase for 3D object detection from point cloud. 
It currently supports multiple state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods with highly refactored codes for both one-stage and two-stage 3D detection frameworks.

Based on `OpenPCDet` toolbox, we win the Waymo Open Dataset challenge in [3D Detection](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/3d-detection/), 
[3D Tracking](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/3d-tracking/), [Domain Adaptation](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/domain-adaptation/) 
three tracks among all LiDAR-only methods, and the Waymo related models will be released to `OpenPCDet` soon.    

We are actively updating this repo currently, and more datasets and models will be supported soon. 
Contributions are also welcomed. 

### `OpenPCDet` design pattern

* Data-Model separation with unified point cloud coordinate for easily extending to custom datasets:
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/dataset_vs_model.png" width="95%" height="320">
</p>

* Unified 3D box definition: (x, y, z, dx, dy, dz, heading).

* Flexible and clear model structure to easily support various 3D detection models:

* Support various models within one framework as:

### Waymo Open Dataset Baselines
We provide the setting of [`DATA_CONFIG.SAMPLED_INTERVAL`](tools/cfgs/dataset_configs/waymo_dataset.yaml) on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) to subsample partial samples for training and evaluation, 
so you could also play with WOD by setting a smaller `DATA_CONFIG.SAMPLED_INTERVAL` even if you only have limited GPU resources. 

By default, all models are trained with **20% data (~32k frames)** of all the training samples on 8 GTX 1080Ti GPUs, and the results of each cell here are mAP/mAPH calculated by the official Waymo evaluation metrics on the **whole** validation set (version 1.2).

We could not provide the above pretrained models due to [Waymo Dataset License Agreement](https://waymo.com/open/terms/), 
but you could easily achieve similar performance by training with the default configs.



### Other datasets
More datasets are on the way.
