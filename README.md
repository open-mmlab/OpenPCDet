## Introduction
`PCDet` is a general PyTorch-based codebase for 3D object detection from point cloud. 
It currently supports several state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods (`PointPillar`, `SECOND`, `Part-A^2 Net`) with highly refactored codes for both one-stage and two-stage frameworks.

This is also the official code release of [`Part-A^2 net`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03670). 

Note that currently this framework mainly contains the voxel-based approaches and we are going to support more point-based approaches in the future. 

### Currently Supported Features
- [x] Support both one-stage and two-stage 3D object detection frameworks
- [x] Distributed training with multiple GPUs and multiple machines, cost about 5 hours to achieve SoTA results on KITTI
- [x] Clear code structure for supporting more datasets and approaches
- [x] RoI-aware point cloud pooling
- [x] GPU version 3D IoU calculation and rotated NMS

## Model Zoo

### KITTI 3D Object Detection Baselines
Supported methods are shown in the below table. The results are the 3D detection performance of car class on the *val* set of KITTI dataset.
All models are trained with 8 GPUs and are available for download.

## Installation

### Requirements
All the codes are tested in the following environment:
* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 14.04/16.04)
* Python 3.6+
* PyTorch 1.1 or higher
* CUDA 9.0 or higher


### Install `pcdet`
1. Clone this repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/sshaoshuai/PCDet.git ---recursive
```

2. Install the dependent libraries as follows:

* Install the dependent python libraries: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

* Install the SparseConv library, we use the non-official implementation from [`spconv`](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv). Note that we use an old version of `spconv`, make sure you install the `spconv v1.0` ([commit 8da6f96](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv/tree/8da6f967fb9a054d8870c3515b1b44eca2103634)) instead of the latest one.

  0. ```cd sponv```

  1. Install boost headers to your system include path, you can use either ```sudo apt-get install libboostall-dev``` or download compressed files from boost official website and copy headers to include path.

  2. Download cmake >= 3.13.2, then add cmake executables to PATH.

  3. Ensure you have install pytorch 1.0 in your environment, run ```python setup.py bdist_wheel``` (don't use ```python setup.py install```).

  4. Run ```cd ./dist```, use pip to install generated whl file.

3. Install this `pcdet` library by running the following command:
```shell
python setup.py develop
```

## Dataset Preparation

Currently we only support KITTI dataset, and contributions are welcomed to support more datasets.

### KITTI Dataset
* Please download the official [KITTI 3D object detection](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=3d) dataset and organize the downloaded files as follows (the road planes could be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5mq0RXRnvHPVeKx6Q612z0YRO1t2wAp/view?usp=sharing), which are optional for data augmentation in the training): 

```

```

* Generate the data infos by running the following command in the path `pcdet/datasets/kitti`: 
```python 
python kitti_dataset.py create_kitti_infos
```

## Getting Started
All the config files are within `tools/cfgs/`. 

### Test and evaluate the pretrained models
* Test with a pretrained model: 
```shell script
python test.py --cfg_file ${CONFIG_FILE} --batch_size 4 --ckpt ${CKPT}
```

* For example, for testing with the above provided `Part-A^2` model, please run the following command (here we add `--set` to modify some default parameters to match with the training setting of the provided `Part-A^2` model, and other provided models do not need to add it): 

```shell script 
python test.py --cfg_file cfgs/PartA2_car.yaml --batch_size 4 --ckpt PartA2.pth \ 
    --set MODEL.RPN.BACKBONE.NAME UNetV0 MODEL.RPN.RPN_HEAD.ARGS use_binary_dir_classifier:True
```

* To evaluate all the saved checkpoints of a specific training setting and draw the performance curve on the Tensorboard, add the `--eval_all` argument: 
```shell script
python test.py --cfg_file ${CONFIG_FILE} --batch_size 4 --eval_all
```


### Train a model
Currently, to train `PointPillar` or `SECOND` or `PartA2`, the `--batch_size` depends on the number of your training GPUs as we use `${BATCH_SIZE}=4*${NUM_GPUS}`, i.e., `--batch_size 32` for training with 8 GPUs. 

* Train with multiple GPUs:
```shell script
sh scripts/dist_train.sh ${NUM_GPUS} \ 
    --cfg_file ${CONFIG_FILE} --batch_size ${BATCH_SIZE}
```

* Train with multiple machines:
```shell script
sh scripts/slurm_train.sh ${PARTITION} ${JOB_NAME} ${NUM_GPUS} \ 
    --cfg_file ${CONFIG_FILE} --batch_size ${BATCH_SIZE}
```

* Train with a single GPU:
```shell script
python train.py --cfg_file ${CONFIG_FILE} --batch_size ${BATCH_SIZE}
```

## Acknowledgement
We would like to thank for [second.pytorch](https://github.com/traveller59/second.pytorch) for providing the original implementation of the one-stage voxel-based framework, 
and there are also some parts of the codes that are modified from [PointRCNN](https://github.com/sshaoshuai/PointRCNN). 

We hope that this repo could serve as a strong and flexible codebase to benefit the research community by speeding up the process of reimplementing previous works and/or developing new methods.
