# OpenPCDet


## Introduction
`OpenPCDet` is a clear, simple, self-contained open source project for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. 

It is also the official code release of [`[Part-A^2 net]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03670) and [`[PV-RCNN]`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13192). 


### What does `OpenPCDet` toolbox do?

Note that we have upgrated `PCDet` from `v0.1` to `v0.2` with pretty new structures to support various datasets and models.

`OpenPCDet` is a general PyTorch-based codebase for 3D object detection from point cloud. 
It currently supports multiple state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods with highly refactored codes for both one-stage and two-stage 3D detection frameworks.

Based on `OpenPCDet` toolbox, we win the Waymo Open Dataset challenge in [3D Detection](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/3d-detection/), 
[3D Tracking](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/3d-tracking/), [Domain Adaptation](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/domain-adaptation/) 
three tracks among all LiDAR-only methods, and the Waymo related models will be released to `OpenPCDet` soon.    

We are actively updating this repo currently, and more datasets and models will be supported soon. 
Contributions are also welcomed. 

### `OpenPCDet` design pattern

* Data-Model separation with unified point cloud coordinate for easily extending to custom datasets:

</p>

* Unified 3D box definition: (x, y, z, dx, dy, dz, heading).

* Flexible and clear model structure to easily support various 3D detection models:

* Support various models within one framework as:

## Acknowledgement
`OpenPCDet` is an open source project for LiDAR-based 3D scene perception that supports multiple
LiDAR-based perception models as shown above. Some parts of `PCDet` are learned from the official released codes of the above supported methods. 
We would like to thank for their proposed methods and the official implementation.   

We hope that this repo could serve as a strong and flexible codebase to benefit the research community by speeding up the process of reimplementing previous works and/or developing new methods.
